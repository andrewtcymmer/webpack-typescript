# Webpack Typescript
This repo captures a boilerplate working framework for building a plain site with HTML, TypeScript, and WebPack.  
The point of this is to use it to get up and going quickly with a dev/prod build. Modify it for your needs.  

# Quick Start
```
npm i
npm build
# Point browser tab to:  file:///home/YourUsername/Projects/webpack-typescript/dist/index.html
```
